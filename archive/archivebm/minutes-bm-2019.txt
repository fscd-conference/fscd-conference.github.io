     session can vote for both the new steering committee members and
     the location on FSCD 2021

2. Report of FSCD'19 PC Chair Herman Geuvers
   - The composition of the PC was done with the intent to obtain a fair
     distribution with respect to topics, geographic location, and gender
     Result: 32 members from 18 countries, including 8 females.
   - There were 2 categories of papers (regular and system description),
     both 15 pages each, excluding references, possibly with an appendix
     in addition.
   - The schedule (only three days for rebuttal, only one week of
     discussion afterwards) turned out to be rather tight
   - Submissions and reviews:
     - 69 regular submissions and one system description were received
       (previous years: 2016 77/5, 2017 74/3, 2018 62/3 regular/system)
     - 77 abstract submissions, so 90% of abstracts materialized into a
       full paper submission,
     - the accepance rate was at 42% (29 out of 69 paper submissions)
     - Most papers had 3 but 5 papers 4 reviews (overall 212 reviews of
       105 external reviewers); reviewing was done with easychair
     - 60 of 69 papers used the rebuttal period to reply, 34 reviews
       were modified
   - Best paper award for junior researchers:
     - 14 candidate papers, 6 only by juniors: majority of PC decided to
       restrict to these 6
     - 2 papers were standing out, after discussion with Delia it was
       decided to give out 2 awards:
       * Mirai Ikebuchi: A Lower Bound of The Number of Rewrite Rules
         Obtained by Homological Methods
       * Jonathan Sterling, Carlo Angiuli and Daniel Gratzer:
         Cubical Syntax for Reflection-Free Extensional Equality
   - Proceedings were done with LipiCS; they were very supportive
     - authors got back paper before ascension day, and had only 3 days to
       check the final version
     - in the future authors should also get diff files of changes
     - participants received proceedings on a USB stick.
     - LMCS special issue planned, with Femke van Raamsdonk as co-editor
   - Talks:
     - conference had 29 contributed regular talks and 1 system description
       (30 minutes talk each)

       topics/geography/gender: Beniamino Accattoli (France), Amy Felty
       (Canada), Sarah Winkler (Austria), Hongseok Yang (South Korea)
   - 7 associated workshops

3. Report of FSCD'19 Conference Chair: Jakob Rehof
   - 7 satellite events: UNIF, WPTE, IFIP 1.6, IWC, HOR, TLLA, SD
   - There were 2 more at FSCD 2017, the overlap with LICS this year is
     considered unfortunate.
   - Participants:
     - 142 FSCD participants: 90 for main conference, 52 workshop only
       169 workshop participations:
       28 UNIF, 32 WPTE, 19 IFIP 1.6, 20 IWC, 17 HOR, 62 TLLA + SD
     - by country France and Germany had largest participation numbers
   - Budget:
     - expenses 70.000 EUR, income 75.000 EUR (around 10.000 EUR
       sponsorships)
     - the central building incurred additional cost but FSCD was also
       sponsored by the city of Dortmund in that rental fee was waived

4. Progress Report of FSCD'20 by Conference Chair Stefano Guerrini
   - Stefano also represents PC Chair Zena Ariola, who is not present
   - FSCD 2020 will be mainly organized by Universite Paris 13
   - due to the colocation with IJCAR, on main days about 300 people
     are expected to be around
   - not yet decided whether two conferences will be in parallel, or one
     conference is shifted such that it will overlap with workshops
   - dates: main conference June 29 - July 2, workshops on July 3 - 5,
     possibly also June 28
   - local organization: Stefano Guerrini (conference chair), Giulio
     Manzonetto (workshop chair), Kaustuv Chaudhuri (IJCAR chair)
   - satellite events will not be associated to either IJCAR or FSCD
   - location:
     - FSCD 2020 will be held at the new research campus Condorcet
     - facilities reserved for whole week, two main lecture halls (250
       and 150p), one large and 5 small conference rooms (50 and 25p)
     - not exactly central, but well connected to public transport
       (20 min to Chatelet-Les Halles)
     - on campus there is also student accommodation, maybe rooms
       for guests, not sure whether they will be already finished
   - next point: raise money (Inria, CNRS, universities, private sponsors)
   - PC is fixed: 40 members, 16 countries, 4 continents, ensuring
     topics and relevant themes covered
   - paper categories: regular and system descriptions (both 15 pages)
   - dates: January 31 abstract, February 5 submission, March 21-23
     rebuttal, April 6 notification

5. Election of two new steering committee members
   - three candidates to replace N. Kobayashi and B. Pientka:
     - Olivier Laurent (ENS Lyon)
     - Damiano Mazza (Univ. Paris-Nord)
     - Jakob Rehof (TU Dortmund)
   - in the election, every voter can give 3-2-1 points to reflect
     decreasing preference (it is not necessary to give all points)
   - result: 155 points for Jakob, 94 for Damiano, 88 for Olivier,
     hence Jakob and Damiano are elected.
